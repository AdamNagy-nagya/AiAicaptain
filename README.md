This is my BSc degree work. 

Abstract

“More than 65% of young people will work in jobs that don’t exist yet—building new technology, advancing artificial intelligence, and designing better ways to analyze data. To succeed in careers across industries, all students need a solid foundation in computer science skills and experience using technology today.”

In this document I introduce a framework designed to support education, made by my friend, Olivér Rottenfoffer and by myself. Our goal was to make a system which aim to share algorithmic thinking and basic knowledge in software programing and automatization, and to do this through a playful visual experience mainly for kids. In addition to the presentation of this program, a program plan will be presented. This program plan makes a recommendation for teaching the basics of programming and programming mentality.
During my writing I would like to guide you through the creation and operation of parts of the system. I present occurrent problems and experiences I have encountered during the development. I will explain the relationships between the components of the framework.
In my work, I wanted to produce a product that can serve as a basis for a potential product for future development. Later use can be a useful help for both educators and learners.
